# ** Derivco Fibonacci API**

This is a WebAPI created by Renan Lucena attending the specification of the document Net Test Task.

On my solution, you will find very go Clean Code (DRY, Classes, Variables and Methods name), Principles, SOLID Principles, Designer Patterns (Builder, Singleton), DDD organization, async programming, recursive.

The time of development was 3 nights and a half and I had to get some knowledge that I didn't have as in Swagger and Postman documentation.

I decided to create using .NET Core because is a new technology and I'm applying to the newest projects that I've worked on.

I tried to show the maximum of my knowledge applicable to this task, of course.

For the tests, I created a XUnit project with some tests to check Exceptions and results using the AAA pattern.

The Swagger Documentation is started when the API runs. I changed the default route to display http://localhost:49640/swagger/index.html
